# API KEY #

The application uses an API key in order to get the information from  [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?_dc=1491949818). If you want to run the code on your computer you need to get an [API KEY](https://www.themoviedb.org/?_dc=1491949818).
<br>Once you have obtained a new key, just copy the key into the `API_KEY` field in the [build.gradle](https://github.com/vpaliyX/PopularMovies/blob/master/presentation/build.gradle) file and you're good to go!
